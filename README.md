# dub
Creates a bar graph in bash terminal that shows relative disk usage of files/directories in a directory.

    Usage:
      dub
      dub [<directory>]
      dub [-h | --help]

    Options:
      -h --help    Show this message.
      <directory>  Show the contents of <directory>

It's a nice, simple way to visualize how much space your contents are consuming.  Much better and clearer than using $(du) and looking at numbers.  Very useful.
