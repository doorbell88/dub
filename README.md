# dub
Creates a bar graph in bash terminal that shows relative disk usage of files/directories in a directory.

    usage:
        $ dub                   # shows bar graph of disk usage in current directory
        $ dub [directory]       # shows bar graph of disk usage in [directory]

It's a nice, simple way to visualize how much space your contents are consuming.  Much better and clearer than using $(du) and looking at numbers.  Very useful.
